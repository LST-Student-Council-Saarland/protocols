Einführungsgespräch mit dem Lehrkörper

1. Mailing lists
- make sure those are fixed, having 2 lists is inconvenient
- for FSR one - give Diana the needed emails, for ASTA one - refer to David
2. Homepage
- get access to the local copy of the old page from Diana
- retire the old page if necessary, think whether we want to rework it or just move to the department page and have a section there
- upload files useful for students to HIZ cloud and link them on the homepage
3. Monthly meeting with department
- potentially set monthly (?) meeting times to meet with study coordinators/Diana
- give three times to study coordinators/Diana
4. Mailing first semester students of CoLi/LangSci
- get email snapshots from study coordinators for that
- otherwise, ASTA should have a full list once everyone enrolled
5. FS Instagram page
- retire it or find a person who will take care of it
- refer to Diana for solving legal issues
6. HIZ Cloud
- everybody got a link
- owners are the people with uni work contracts
7. Signing for keys
- need to sign the new protocol for keys
- each person probably should sign for the key given with them, to divide responsibility
- give names of who has them to Diana
8. SC room organization
- request furniture to be removed/brought to SC room if needed
- clean it
9. Poster rules
- do not attach on wooden panels or walls, better on doors, information boards, whiteboards in common rooms
- can put them in A2.2, C7.4, C7.3
10. TdOT
- take rollup from Diana
- flyers to be updated and picked up - when new academic programs are approved
11. Academic update for LangSc
- sign off by SC needed
- further discussion by LangSci/CoLi
12. Academic complaints
- reach out to study coordinators first in an organized manner, e.g. via email
