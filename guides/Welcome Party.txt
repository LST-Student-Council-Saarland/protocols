-----------------
--Welcome Party--
-----------------

Who:	Students and PhDs only
		(Why? Because Faculty do not want to join)
		
What:	A Welcome Party for the new year intake
		Also: Halloween party if people want to 
			put the extra work into it

Where: 	C7 Foyer, C7 Seminar Room, C7 Library

When: 	Late October - Mid November
		Friday/Saturday
		19h - 1h
		Prep (18h - 19h)
		Clean (0h - 1h)

Why:	Many 1st years will not meet later year
		students unless they do social events, also 
		it's a good way to take the edge off early on.

--Requirements---
-----------------

Food/Drink:
			Drinks 	Yes
			Food 	No
			
Order List:
			Beer	4-5 Total crates of small beers (sold at 1 Euro)
					Any variety mix, but 1 radler and 1 pils for sure
			
			Soda/Juice
					1-2 Total bottles of any variety
					
Costs:
		16 x 4-5 =	64 - 80
		2 x 1-2  =	2  - 4
		Total		66 - 84*   But if beer is sold at cost it will be far less*

Prep/Clean:
			Prep will be done before the event with typically volunteers, you will clear
				out the seminar room of the tables or move them aside and take three out
				to the Foyer to form a service table for food and drinks accross the wall
				where C7.4 is facing. You may also use the decorations we own in the SC
				room if they're appropriate, but the general rule is: "if you want them up, 
				you must be here to take them down"
			
			Cleaning will be done starting at 12 typically but can be earlier when there are
				not enough volunteers or closers. You will ask everyone to leave the Seminar 
				Room and clean there following the guidelines document, then you will close
				the Library room and repeat, then you will remove the tables from the Foyer 
				back to the Seminar room. If there are leftover foods that are open, they are 
				offered to SC first and then everyone else second, otherwise they are thrown 
				out. Closed food is okay to store in SC. At the end of the night, make sure
				someone goes through the checklist we are provided before usherig everyone 
				outside.
				
Organization:
	Ordering the Rooms:
		- SC Presidents will be in charge of handling the room reservations
			- the email may be changed so please refer to whoever is the previous SC President
		- These rooms should be requested at least two weeks to month in advance if possible
			- expect push back on this the entire time. 

	Shifts:		Normal Length				Shorter Length
			Prep: 	18:00h - 19:30h		18:00h - 19:45h		Prep
			First:	19:30h - 21:00h		19:45h - 21:30h		First
			Sec:	21:00h - 22:30h		21:30h - 23:15h		Second
			Third:	22:30h - 00:00h		23:15h - 00:00h		Close
			Close:	00:00h - 01:00h
			
	Shift Assumptions:
		- For non-Summer/Winter Parties, there is only two shifts that need many people: Prep/Close
		- Assume that you will typically have one person not be present for each shift, so these 
			numbers are inflated to deal with that. 
		- First/Second/Third will mainly handle collecting alcohol, giving out nametags, cleaning any
			messes, and restocking anything that may be lost.
	
	# of People per Shift:
		Prep: 4-5
		First/Second/Third 2-3
		Close: 4-5

Survey Information:
		Found in Google Forms, here for posterity if needed
	
		- Description: Give a summary of the event here, let them know that +1's are welcome and that nametags 
			will be provided there for everyone. 
			- If the SC has enough people, you can always host it with a 
				Halloween or Ice breaker theme too but I would lean AGAINST this if you don't have 
				the base # of people from above.
			- Explain the Drink Policy and that it is a Food Potluck (meaning that they will provide food not us)
		
		- Inputs: 
			- Their REAL name
			- If they would like to volunteer and what shifts they would be interested in (ask for options, not specifics***)
				- ask for their email if they say YES to volunteering
				- The week before the party we will send out an excel sheet image to them with their shift time and what it entails
			- If they would like to bring food.
				- ask what type of food, and the category (non vegetarian, vegetarian, vegan, etc)
				- also offer them the option to say I dont know
		- Theme:
			- If there is a theme that is added, offer additional questions here.
			- Halloween: 
				- Offer a prize of beer or something silly
			- Icebreaker: 
				- Same thing as above
