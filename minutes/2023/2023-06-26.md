# FSR Meeting

## Open Mic Night Review
- really great! Drinks and snacks consumed, talent shared, acts documented, sound dj'ed, later karaoke enjoyed.
- intermission with pizza = nice
- need audio interface for future
  - in addition to a laptop
  - best solution: see if the uni has a small mixing device we can borrow
- suggest: to participants to introduce what they’re doing
- => microphone: email Nico to keep for next event or return

## Uni Picnic
- => ch will ask Diana for building access for bathrooms
- Friday July 7th 6 pm
- bring out drinks we still have
- SC won't provide alcohol or food
- tell students to bring food/drinks to share if they'd like (potluck)
- tell students to bring blankets

## Alpaca Event
- ya may ask for next semester 

## Goodbye party
- smaller than summer party food budget
- mock graduation with faux diplomas
- goodbye speech for <redacted>, eulogy for T
- normal party, karaoke at the end
- ordering food: do ahead of time, have google sheet, ask people to pitch in a euro
- have pizza table to collect money
- => make goodbye form: have people sign up, say if they’re leaving
- ma will invite previous faculty 
- => ch will email Diana
- Wuggies ~ would make sense for just the people leaving. We can tell the interested student that they're welcome to organize it.
