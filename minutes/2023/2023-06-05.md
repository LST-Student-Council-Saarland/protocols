# FSR Meeting

## Summer Party Feedback

### positives
- fun!! drinks in the corner good idea
- string lights + flags = yay ;)
- marshmallows liked
- lots of food
- good bachelor turnout
- bread = good amount, keep
- beer = good amount, keep
- potato wedges = good -> double it next year?

### critiques / what to do for next time
- lots of meat left over
- :: make it clear which side of Schwenker is free for all, or specific to person (people must watch their food). Divide half the grill with aluminum foil?

- :: add lights for the money and drinks table. yz will donate one?
- :: spacing critique: move schwenker not next to door
- :: start earlier: 6 is better for faculty/PhD students/people with kids
