# FSR Meeting

## Summer Party Feedback

### positives
- fun!! drinks in the corner good idea
- marshmallows liked
- lots of food
- good bachelor turnout
- bread = good amount, keep
- beer = good amount, keep
- potato wedges = good -> double it next year?

### critiques
- lots of meat left over
- next time: make it clear which side of schwenker is free for all, or specific to person (people must watch food). Divide half the grill with aluminum foil?
- next time: bring skewers for marshmallows + more marshmallows
- next time: lights for the money and drinks booth. j will donate one?
- spacing critique: move schwenker not next to door
- start earlier: 6 is better for faculty/PhD students/people with kids
- next time: have a plan for closing/cleanup ahead of time -> helps with volunteers and delegating
